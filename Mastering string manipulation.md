## String Literals and Quotation Marks

In Python, strings can be created using single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).

```python
# Single quotes
str1 = 'Hello World'

# Double quotes
str2 = "Python Programming"

# Triple quotes for multiline strings
str3 = """This is a
multiline string"""
```

**Why different quote types?**
- Allows you to include one type of quote inside another without escaping
- Triple quotes preserve line breaks and formatting

```python
# Using single quotes inside double quotes
message = "He said, 'Hello there!'"

# Using double quotes inside single quotes
response = 'She replied, "Hi!"'
```

## Escape Characters

Escape characters allow you to include special characters in strings that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to represent directly.

Common escape sequences:

| Escape Sequence | Meaning                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| `\'`            | Single quote             |
| `\"`            | Double quote             |
| `\\`            | Backslash                |
| `\n`            | Newline                  |
| `\t`            | Tab                      |
| `\r`            | Carriage return          |
| `\b`            | Backspace                |
| `\f`            | Form feed                |
| `\ooo`          | Octal value              |
| `\xhh`          | Hexadecimal value        |

**Examples:**

```python
# Using escape characters
path = "C:\\Users\\Documents\\file.txt"  # Backslashes in Windows paths
quote = 'He said, \"Python is awesome!\"'
multiline = "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
```

## Raw Strings

Raw strings treat backslashes as literal characters, which is particularly useful for regular expressions and Windows file paths.

```python
# Regular string vs raw string
regular_str = "C:\\Users\\Documents"  # Needs double backslashes
raw_str = r"C:\Users\Documents"      # Treats backslashes literally

print(regular_str)  # C:\Users\Documents
print(raw_str)      # C:\Users\Documents
```

**When to use raw strings:**
- Regular expression patterns
- Windows file paths
- Any string with many backslashes

## Multiline Strings

Triple-quoted strings preserve all whitespace and newlines:

```python
multiline = """This is a string
that spans multiple
lines exactly as written."""

print(multiline)
```

Output:
```
This is a string
that spans multiple
lines exactly as written.
```

Multiline strings are often used for:
- Docstrings (documentation)
- SQL queries
- Long messages or templates
- Preserving formatting in text

## String Indexing and Slicing

Python strings are sequences of characters and support indexing and slicing operations.

### Indexing

```python
text = "Python"
print(text[0])   # 'P' - first character
print(text[-1])  # 'n' - last character
```

### Slicing

Syntax: `string[start:end:step]`

```python
text = "Hello World"

print(text[0:5])    # 'Hello' - characters 0 to 4
print(text[6:])     # 'World' - from index 6 to end
print(text[:5])     # 'Hello' - from start to index 4
print(text[-5:])    # 'World' - last 5 characters
print(text[::2])    # 'HloWrd' - every second character
print(text[::-1])   # 'dlroW olleH' - reversed string
```

**Important notes:**
- Indices start at 0
- The end index is not included in the slice
- Negative indices count from the end (-1 is last character)
- Omitting start/end defaults to beginning/end of string

## String Concatenation and Repetition

### Concatenation

Combining strings with `+`:

```python
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Alice"
message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
print(message)  # "Hello, Alice!"
```

### Repetition

Repeating strings with `*`:

```python
line = "-" * 30
print(line)  # "------------------------------"

chant = "Hey " * 3
print(chant)  # "Hey Hey Hey "
```

## Common String Methods

Python provides numerous built-in string methods for manipulation and inspection.

### Case Conversion

```python
text = "Python Programming"

print(text.lower())      # 'python programming'
print(text.upper())      # 'PYTHON PROGRAMMING'
print(text.title())      # 'Python Programming'
print(text.capitalize()) # 'Python programming'
print(text.swapcase())   # 'pYTHON pROGRAMMING'
```

### Searching and Checking

```python
text = "Python is awesome"

# Checking content
print(text.startswith("Python"))  # True
print(text.endswith("awesome"))   # True
print("thon" in text)             # True

# Finding positions
print(text.find("is"))       # 7 (index where "is" starts)
print(text.rfind("o"))       # 14 (last occurrence of 'o')
print(text.index("awe"))     # 10 (similar to find but raises error if not found)
```

### Validation Methods

```python
# Check if all characters meet certain criteria
print("abc123".isalnum())   # True (letters or numbers)
print("abc".isalpha())      # True (letters only)
print("123".isdigit())      # True (digits only)
print("3.14".isdecimal())   # False (decimal numbers only)
print("   ".isspace())      # True (whitespace only)
print("Title Case".istitle()) # True (title case)
```

### Splitting and Joining

```python
# Splitting
csv = "apple,banana,cherry"
fruits = csv.split(",")  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

lines = "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3".splitlines()  # ['Line 1', 'Line 2', 'Line 3']

# Joining
words = ["Python", "is", "great"]
sentence = " ".join(words)  # "Python is great"
```

### Stripping Whitespace

```python
text = "   some text   "

print(text.strip())   # "some text" (both sides)
print(text.lstrip())  # "some text   " (left side)
print(text.rstrip())  #   "some text" (right side)

# Can also strip specific characters
text = "xxxyyyHello Worldyyyxxx"
print(text.strip("xy"))  # "Hello World"
```

### Replacement

```python
text = "I like cats and cats are great"

# Simple replacement
new_text = text.replace("cats", "dogs")
print(new_text)  # "I like dogs and dogs are great"

# Replace with count limit
print(text.replace("cats", "dogs", 1))  # Only replace first occurrence
```

### Alignment and Padding

```python
text = "Python"

print(text.ljust(10, "-"))  # 'Python----'
print(text.rjust(10, "-"))  # '----Python'
print(text.center(10, "-")) # '--Python--'

# Formatting numbers with leading zeros
num = "42"
print(num.zfill(5))  # '00042'
```

## String Formatting

Python offers several ways to format strings.

### Old-style (%) Formatting

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print("Hello, %s. You are %d years old." % (name, age))
```

### str.format() Method

```python
print("Hello, {}. You are {} years old.".format(name, age))
print("Hello, {1}. You are {0} years old.".format(age, name))
print("Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.".format(name=name, age=age))
```

### f-strings (Python 3.6+)

```python
print(f"Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.")
print(f"Next year you'll be {age + 1} years old.")

# Formatting numbers
pi = 3.14159
print(f"Pi is approximately {pi:.2f}")  # "Pi is approximately 3.14"
```

### Template Strings

```python
from string import Template
t = Template("Hello, $name. You are $age years old.")
print(t.substitute(name=name, age=age))
```

## String Membership Testing

Check if substrings exist within strings:

```python
text = "Python programming"

print("Python" in text)    # True
print("python" in text)    # False (case-sensitive)
print("thon" not in text)  # False
```

## String Comparison

Strings can be compared using standard comparison operators:

```python
print("apple" == "apple")  # True
print("apple" == "Apple")  # False (case-sensitive)
print("apple" < "banana")  # True (lexicographical order)
print("apple" > "Apple")   # True (lowercase > uppercase in ASCII)
```

**Important note:** String comparison is case-sensitive and based on Unicode code points.

## Useful String Operations

### Length

```python
text = "Hello"
print(len(text))  # 5
```

### Counting Substrings

```python
text = "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"
print(text.count("wood"))  # 4
```

### Partitioning

```python
text = "Python:Programming:Language"
print(text.partition(":"))  # ('Python', ':', 'Programming:Language')
print(text.rpartition(":")) # ('Python:Programming', ':', 'Language')
```

### Translation

```python
# Create a translation table
translation = str.maketrans("aeiou", "12345")
text = "This is an example"
print(text.translate(translation))  # "Th3s 3s 1n 2x1mpl2"
```

### Enumerating Characters

```python
for index, char in enumerate("Hello"):
    print(f"Character {char} at position {index}")
```

## Practical Applications

### Password Strength Checker

```python
def is_strong_password(password):
    """Check if password meets strength requirements"""
    return (len(password) >= 8 and
            any(c.isupper() for c in password) and
            any(c.islower() for c in password) and
            any(c.isdigit() for c in password) and
            any(not c.isalnum() for c in password))

print(is_strong_password("Weak1"))      # False
print(is_strong_password("Strong123!")) # True
```

### Text Processing Pipeline

```python
def process_text(text):
    """Clean and normalize text for analysis"""
    # Convert to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    # Remove punctuation
    punctuation = """!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~"""
    text = "".join(c for c in text if c not in punctuation)
    # Remove extra whitespace
    text = " ".join(text.split())
    return text

sample = "  This is an EXAMPLE text, with SOME punctuation!  "
print(process_text(sample))  # "this is an example text with some punctuation"
```

### Generating Reports

```python
def generate_report(data):
    """Format data into a readable report"""
    header = "{:<15} {:<10} {:<10}".format("Name", "Age", "Score")
    separator = "-" * len(header)
    rows = []
    for item in data:
        rows.append("{:<15} {:<10} {:<10.2f}".format(
            item["name"], item["age"], item["score"]))
    return "\n".join([header, separator] + rows)

data = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "score": 89.5},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "score": 92.3},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 28, "score": 85.0}
]

print(generate_report(data))
```

### Working with the Clipboard

```python
import pyperclip

# Copy to clipboard
pyperclip.copy("This text will be copied to clipboard")

# Paste from clipboard
text = pyperclip.paste()
print(f"Clipboard contains: {text}")

# Example: Convert clipboard text to uppercase
text = pyperclip.paste()
pyperclip.copy(text.upper())
```

## Conclusion

Python's string handling capabilities are powerful and versatile. Mastering string manipulation is essential for tasks ranging from simple text processing to complex data analysis. By understanding and applying the concepts covered in this guide, you'll be well-equipped to handle any text processing challenge in Python.

Remember that strings are immutable in Python - operations that modify strings actually create new string objects. For intensive string manipulation, consider using `io.StringIO` or list operations followed by `join()` for better performance.

The string methods and techniques covered here form the foundation for working with text in Python, and they're used extensively in web development, data science, automation scripts, and virtually every other Python application domain.

Here are the answers to the practice questions:

### 1. What are escape characters?
Escape characters are special sequences that represent characters that are difficult or impossible to type directly in strings. They begin with a backslash (`\`) followed by a character that has special meaning. For example:
- `\n` represents a newline
- `\t` represents a tab
- `\'` represents a single quote
- `\"` represents a double quote

### 2. What do the \n and \t escape characters represent?
- `\n` represents a newline character (line break)
- `\t` represents a tab character (horizontal indentation)

### 3. How can you put a \ backslash character in a string?
You can include a backslash in a string by escaping it with another backslash:
```python
path = "C:\\Users\\Documents"  # Shows as C:\Users\Documents
```
Or by using a raw string:
```python
path = r"C:\Users\Documents"
```

### 4. Why isn't it a problem that the single quote in "Howl's Moving Castle" isn't escaped?
Because the string is enclosed in double quotes (`"`), Python doesn't interpret the single quote (`'`) inside as a string delimiter. Python only looks for matching quotes of the same type used to start the string.

### 5. How can you write a string with newlines without using \n?
You can use triple-quoted strings (either `'''` or `"""`):
```python
multiline = """This string
has multiple lines
without using \n"""
```

### 6. What do these expressions evaluate to?
- `'Hello world!'[1]` → `'e'` (second character, index 1)
- `'Hello world!'[0:5]` → `'Hello'` (characters from index 0 to 4)
- `'Hello world!'[:5]` → `'Hello'` (same as above, start defaults to 0)
- `'Hello world!'[3:]` → `'lo world!'` (from index 3 to end)

### 7. What do these expressions evaluate to?
- `'Hello'.upper()` → `'HELLO'`
- `'Hello'.upper().isupper()` → `True` (HELLO is all uppercase)
- `'Hello'.upper().lower()` → `'hello'`

### 8. What do these expressions evaluate to?
- `'Remember, remember, the fifth of November.'.split()` → 
  `['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'November.']`
- `'-'.join('There can be only one.'.split())` → 
  `'There-can-be-only-one.'`

### 9. What string methods can you use to justify text?
- Right-justify: `str.rjust(width[, fillchar])`
- Left-justify: `str.ljust(width[, fillchar])`
- Center: `str.center(width[, fillchar])`

Example:
```python
print('hello'.rjust(10))      # '     hello'
print('hello'.ljust(10, '-')) # 'hello-----'
print('hello'.center(10))     # '  hello   '
```

### 10. How can you trim whitespace from strings?
- `strip()` - removes whitespace from both ends
- `lstrip()` - removes whitespace from the left end
- `rstrip()` - removes whitespace from the right end

Example:
```python
text = "   some text   "
print(text.strip())   # "some text"
print(text.lstrip())  # "some text   "
print(text.rstrip())  # "   some text"
```

These methods can also remove specific characters:
```python
text = "xxxyyyHello Worldyyyxxx"
print(text.strip('xy'))  # "Hello World"
```
